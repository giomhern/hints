# Introducing Hints

Your very own customizable wordle. Built with [Supabase Realtime](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime) and [NextJS](https://nextjs.org).

## Local Setup 

Install missing dependencies using your preferred package manager:

```
npm install 
```

Create an `.env` file in the root of the repository. Create your Supabase db environment variables. Example below:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL = "https://fipryeevuxqurfkepall.supabase.co"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY = "ey8129h33181jcds03290"
```

Make sure your db is configured using the following SQL which you can run in the Supabase SQL editor. 

That's it! Run your dev server:

```
npm run dev
```
